2
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:05,590
Say it louder! Game?

3
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:12,047
He is B L K D, "Balakid" is how you read-

4
00:03:12,247 --> 00:03:14,996
his name he came up with, containing 4 letters. Psh!

5
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:16,765
I will silence you, dumbass.

6
00:03:16,965 --> 00:03:19,758
Until you're mute with a slice to your throat

7
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,478
Ya'll notice how his voice (tinig) is gone?
("pa tinig" a bit of a homophone of "patinig", patinig is Tagalog for vowel.)
(Lanzeta is trying to derive 2 meanings (voice and vowel) from the pa-ti-nig sound)

8
00:03:22,678 --> 00:03:26,252
Let's make it so that his name will vanish
when I make his consonants (katinig) disappear!
("BLKD" is all consonants so his name will really be gone
if you remove all the consonants, the same applies for
the "Balakid" name derivation because
he removed all the vowels too from earlier)

9
00:03:26,452 --> 00:03:28,185
Me? I'm still young, thats right. Ha!

10
00:03:28,385 --> 00:03:30,929
They're all thinking that I don't respect my elders and-

11
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:32,578
that all of you are so old!

12
00:03:32,778 --> 00:03:35,297
They're telling me that you are the standard?

13
00:03:35,497 --> 00:03:37,773
They're forcing and squeezing in this narrative

14
00:03:37,973 --> 00:03:39,865
but they don't realize until its too late

15
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:46,132
that death doesn't discriminate when it comes to age

16
00:03:46,332 --> 00:03:48,031
Oh no! Ha!

17
00:03:48,032 --> 00:03:49,913
He's in front of the one that will take him (to the afterlife)

18
00:03:50,113 --> 00:03:52,005
Audaciously making a plan marked with a skull,
(this translation is very literal but I think he's just saying
verbosely that he's planning his death)

19
00:03:52,008 --> 00:03:55,224
marked with bones (tatak buto) / he will run (tatakbo to)
when I'm filled with anger. And when this plan is done-
("ta-tak-bu-to" can have two meanings, tatak buto and tatakbo to)

20
00:03:55,424 --> 00:03:59,675
The blood will spill and boil, and in time
the lake of blood will dry up

21
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,613
I'll take out a knife

22
00:04:01,813 --> 00:04:03,121
stab and stab you till something spills out

23
00:04:03,321 --> 00:04:05,468
nothing will be able to cover and hide you
after I'm done. You will be stepped on-

24
00:04:05,668 --> 00:04:09,244
the street filled with trouble and mess.
Every step with intent to kill.

25
00:04:09,444 --> 00:04:11,736
Your name is my angle. You're the obstacle?
(Balakid is Tagalog for obstacle)

26
00:04:11,936 --> 00:04:14,734
When I run through you, there's nothing
that will stop my plan

27
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:19,145
And you're the "future" they say?
(BLKD was dubbed the future of Filipino rap battling)

28
00:04:19,345 --> 00:04:22,046
I've designed a sharp scythe just for you
so its just right that-

29
00:04:22,246 --> 00:04:25,597
You are the future and I am the present (mangyayari)
(Mangyayari can also mean 'to finish', in this context he will
be the one to finish BLKD)

30
00:04:25,797 --> 00:04:28,372
There will be no obstacle when I go straight through

31
00:04:28,572 --> 00:04:34,579
BLKD, block, obstacle?
And fuck, you're also a fence bro?
(He's enumerating words synonymous to balakid)

32
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:37,249
Knock knock? *Who's there*

33
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:39,296
I've climbed my way up to you

34
00:04:39,496 --> 00:04:46,863
When I finally reach you,
you'll get butchered at your home

35
00:04:47,063 --> 00:04:51,591
Then I'll catch a case. But I think there
is no wrong in doing a killing in this backyard.

36
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,533
He can't have me under control

37
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:55,618
You want to play with me?

38
00:04:55,818 --> 00:04:57,453
Do you remember back when-

39
00:04:57,653 --> 00:04:59,015
you battled someone dumb?

40
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,907
That's why you're battling me now,
someone from 'Gapo (Olonngapo)
(The city Lanzeta is from)

41
00:05:01,107 --> 00:05:03,499
And this is your fault sir *pointing to Anygma*

42
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:10,278
Ha! So that you'll remember 2khelle when
you get swept by someone whack (bano)
(He's referencing BLKD's battle with 2khelle that BLKD lost.
2khelle is known as whack. Battlers from Olonggapo
are often chastised jokingly for being whack because of this)

43
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:12,690
'Clinging to a knife' is prevalent with us

44
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,651
BLKD was brought to us, and 'he' was served

45
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:16,750
You got cooked in 'Gapo-
(Cooked or "luto" in Tagalog can mean "rigged", he's pertaining
to BLKD's losing to 2khelle was rigged)

46
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:19,099
so that now they can have me eat you!

47
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:21,159
Alright, lets move on

48
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:24,146
How have you been, being poor and all?

49
00:05:24,346 --> 00:05:27,139
Hey don't look away, that wasn't me making fun of you

50
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:34,576
Just like what Japormz did to Kahir, I'll spit on your face. Pweh!
(He's referencing a Fliptop battle where an MC spit on his opponent)

51
00:05:34,776 --> 00:05:41,182
Remember what BLKD said? "This is a fight of crime and sedition"

52
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:46,274
"Miriam Defensor vs Rhyzza Mae Dizon"
(Miriam Defensor was a senator and a strong debater, and Rhyzza is a kid actor-comedian)

53
00:05:46,474 --> 00:05:48,866
That's what you bring to a battle?

54
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:51,056
You (BLKD) keep saying "this is my creation", "that's my creation"

55
00:05:51,256 --> 00:05:53,093
and you (the fans) are swayed by him?

56
00:05:53,293 --> 00:05:56,362
You keep doing 'sumbat' and bringing up your contributions,
and you (the fans) are swayed by him?
(Sumbat is when you constantly remind someone about something you’ve done for them to make them feel little)

57
00:05:56,562 --> 00:06:02,275
These fans are easily impressed because they're shallow.
Now let me show you something, game?

58
00:06:02,475 --> 00:06:04,185
One more time, game?

59
00:06:04,385 --> 00:06:11,145
You remember you said "A shallow stab was done by Lanzeta"
(Lanzeta is actually a kind of knife)

60
00:06:11,345 --> 00:06:14,050
So now I stab you, that's what Lanzeta did

61
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:19,711
So Bathala (God) forgive me
for what Lanzeta did, for what the lanzeta did, and for the maker of the lanzeta
(I'm actually not 100% sure what he really meant here)

62
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:23,312
So what are our similarities? Why do people compare you to me?

63
00:06:23,512 --> 00:06:27,074
Is it in the way you create? Because your lines are deep?

64
00:06:27,274 --> 00:06:29,848
Is it in the way you create? Where did it come from?

65
00:06:30,048 --> 00:06:33,913
It came from Lanzeta, so you're made from Lanzeta / finished by Lanzeta
(Yari can both mean the make of something, or to finish)

66
00:06:34,113 --> 00:06:37,411
Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Stealing and thieving?

67
00:06:37,611 --> 00:06:40,409
This is what some people tell me, and I've noticed as well

68
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:46,350
So many have told me. No one needs to hear it from anyone else,

69
00:06:46,351 --> 00:06:50,595
this one came from me!
(Another play on words, can mean both "straight from the horse's mouth" and "he came from me")

70
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:52,999
You perform your poetry, but where does your poetry come from?

71
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,208
I will slap that poetry onto your face that
came from me / got red because of me
(na-mu-la can be interpreted as "got red" or "it came from")

72
00:06:56,408 --> 00:06:58,061
then I'll point a gun at you

73
00:06:58,261 --> 00:07:00,188
will this guy be able to 'sumbat'? Bang!

74
00:07:00,388 --> 00:07:03,197
This will go through this wall, its right that
it came from you / gun shot that came from you
(Tama can mean 'correct'. Or 'shot' in this context because of the gun setup from earlier)

75
00:07:03,397 --> 00:07:06,691
If this guy is the basis, all of you should have yourselves checked

76
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:09,146
Come over here and I'll bring you to your maker

77
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:10,657
Look back from where you came from

78
00:07:10,857 --> 00:07:12,383
until the maker takes you back

79
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:15,676
and then that'll be the time I return you to your maker

80
00:07:15,876 --> 00:07:17,655
Because your intention is to steal something from me

81
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:21,475
When you look at it, your reflection in the water is deep,

82
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,579
its dark. You're drowned there because-

83
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:26,242
you're so well known, I'll rise you up / make you really popular this time

84
00:07:26,442 --> 00:07:27,974
But I'll overtake you first, I'll put a hole in you. Baow!

85
00:07:28,174 --> 00:07:29,735
Now you wont be rising up anymore

86
00:07:29,935 --> 00:07:31,124
So, you're that known?

87
00:07:31,324 --> 00:07:33,539
Compadre (pre) that's wrong.
This kid will break you.

88
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:35,705
He imitated in a patchy way.
Doing everything-

89
00:07:35,905 --> 00:07:40,271
everyone will see him broken into parts
when he looks he'll see that he's in pieces,

90
00:07:40,471 --> 00:07:41,895
shattered mirror.

91
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:44,306
Why? Is he the culprit?

92
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:45,834
When all of these MCs are criminals,

93
00:07:46,034 --> 00:07:49,046
crimes of imitating others, no ones original.

94
00:07:49,246 --> 00:07:53,797
Who are the MCs here that can really say they have a style of their own?

95
00:07:53,997 --> 00:07:55,014
Answer!

96
00:07:55,214 --> 00:07:56,515
Bitch please!

97
00:07:56,715 --> 00:07:59,883
The truth will surface and seethe,

98
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,087
because all of them are too raw

99
00:08:01,287 --> 00:08:05,005
They can't do what I do, even my screams

100
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,682
Even you BLKD (maging ikaw), you can't-

101
00:08:06,882 --> 00:08:09,915
You can't even become yourself (maging ikaw),
now do your 'sumbat' repa (slang for compadre)
(Maging ikaw has two meanings, here in this line, and from the previous line)

102
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,424
I've overtaken these MCs, and they got surprised

103
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:15,367
Starting from a blank paper daubed with ink

104
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:19,567
And you're the pader (wall) that I wrote on,
binaboy na kita (I insulted you)

105
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:22,213
Is he really a pader (wall)?
This guy who's being idolized?

106
00:08:22,413 --> 00:08:23,865
Heh, right I'm a durugista (drug addict)

107
00:08:24,065 --> 00:08:28,809
A karit (scythe) and hammer, a symbol for
this communist
(BLKD is a known left-leaning activist so he's labelled as a communist)

108
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,362
Because you're poor right?

109
00:08:31,562 --> 00:08:36,576
But nowadays he doesn't wear his glasses anymore, because he
now sees clearly / makes money
(BLKD wore glasses in his previous battles from way back,
Lanzeta is wittingly saying that BLKD now sees clearly and makes money.
"Kita" can mean sight or income here)

110
00:08:38,776 --> 00:08:43,510
Before he was an activist, but now turned artista (actor),
named B L K D

111
00:08:43,511 --> 00:08:47,680
Son of a whore, kapitalista! (capitalist)
(He's saying that its ironic that BLKD turned into a capitalist
now that he's earning money, while also pointing
out that he's also a 'capitalist' in the sense that his name is ALL CAPS)

112
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,900
So fall in line in the streets, bitch,
with the other whores.

113
00:08:51,901 --> 00:08:54,152
His name that I'll bring down I'll step on

114
00:08:54,352 --> 00:08:55,259
the ground where I want him

115
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,853
If you really are with the Kadamay
(A partylist in the PH for the poor,
kadamay also means 'someone who's with you in pain')

116
00:08:57,053 --> 00:08:58,912
damay-damay (all of you will be together) in the destruction
of your home

117
00:08:59,112 --> 00:09:01,252
umiyak kang walang tahanan
(then you'll sob without stopping / then you'll cry because you have no home)
('ta-ha-nan' here can both mean 'end of sobbing' and 'home')

118
00:09:01,452 --> 00:09:03,819
ba-ba-ha-yang luha
(it will flood with your tears / your tears will be housed)

119
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:07,652
and the next time this guy burns another effigy,
(activists in the PH make effigies of hated politicians as a symbol of protest)

120
00:09:07,852 --> 00:09:13,295
they'll all explode definitely, when I throw at them an open LPG!
(LPG is Liquid Petroleum Gas, its typically a meter high gas canister)

121
00:09:13,495 --> 00:09:16,052
You can call me Mendiola Massacre!
(A well-known political killing in the PH)

122
00:09:16,252 --> 00:09:18,372
and you've just lined up for me to be killed

123
00:09:18,572 --> 00:09:20,631
I'm Bimby Aquino - Cojuanco
(He's referencing a popular child belonging from the Aquino - Cojuanco family,
the family that is known to be the culprit behind Mendiola Massacre.
And Lanzeta has been made fun for looking a lot like Bimby lol)

124
00:09:20,831 --> 00:09:25,620
This is Hacienda Luisita!
(The site where the killings happened)

125
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,026
Basta 'Gapo bano? (If you're from Olonggapo you're a whack MC)
("Basta 'Gapo bano" is a commonly reiterated chant in Fliptop directing
playful resentment towards Olonggapo MCs. This started from when BLKD
was undeservingly defeated by 2khelle)

126
00:09:28,226 --> 00:09:31,666
You still can't move on from that?
Oh Basta 'Gapo bano?

127
00:09:31,866 --> 00:09:34,653
From where it all started, that's where it'll end

128
00:09:34,853 --> 00:09:37,008
You can't handle that I'm mahangin? (boastfull)

129
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,732
Then keep that buried in your chest

130
00:09:38,932 --> 00:09:40,667
This new design of lanzeta,

131
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:43,000
don't forget and keep it marked within your minds!
(Those last four lines is Lanzeta's signature ender to his battles)

132
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:00,269
Hey bata (kid)

133
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:02,506
You've just said that you're mahangin (boastful, full of air)

134
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:07,502
But your air, is just you bragging that can't be pacified

135
00:10:07,702 --> 00:10:11,050
While my air is for the swaying of the flag

136
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:17,160
Because my voice is amihan (northeast monsoon winds),
the air I blow is habagat (southwest monsoon winds)

137
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,839
So bata (kid), no?

138
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:26,485
You we're a bata (flunkey) of 2khelle

139
00:10:26,685 --> 00:10:29,983
That he himself was the flunkey of Nico
(Another Fliptop MC from Olonggapo)

140
00:10:30,183 --> 00:10:35,722
Just from that, I should have two wins,
Why are you even here?

141
00:10:35,922 --> 00:10:37,926
A kid that's aggresive?

142
00:10:38,126 --> 00:10:39,634
Someone who kills people?

143
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:45,034
But weren't you just pushed around by a flunkey of Kardo?
(He's referring to Shernan a Fliptop MC turned actor in a hit TV
show in the PH where Kardo is the leading character.
Shernan also had real beef with Lanzeta)

144
00:10:45,234 --> 00:10:48,744
But this kid isn't really lacking in years of experience,
he lacked in courage

145
00:10:48,944 --> 00:10:53,893
gulang (age) doesn't matter that much,
but gulang (cunning) matters!

146
00:10:54,093 --> 00:10:58,495
That's why your brutality in battle doesn't sell

147
00:10:58,695 --> 00:11:03,035
I just proved this Lanzeta/lanzeta tiklop (folds)
(The lanzeta knife actually has a a mechanism that lets it fold itself,
so its fitting that he pointed out that Lanzeta the MC
also folds when being pushed around)

148
00:11:03,235 --> 00:11:04,939
You're just a weapon for a fight

149
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:06,784
While I'm a weapon for war

150
00:11:06,984 --> 00:11:13,876
You'll suddenly lie down dead on the BANG-keta (Bangketa is sidewalk)

151
00:11:14,076 --> 00:11:16,815
The bullet is really pointed at the head

152
00:11:17,015 --> 00:11:18,780
Bang! His skull will shake,

153
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,216
A downpour of blood

154
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:24,170
But this isn't Tokhang, that pretends that it doesn't know that innocents are killed
(Tokhang is a term for the anti-drug campaign in the PH where innocents are killed)

155
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:36,648
How would he fight back, someone who doesn't have the means to fight back?
(In Tokhang, the police usually says that suspects are killed
on the spot because they fought back, but this is not true most of the time
because outside investigations have proven that 'suspects'
didn't even fight back and had no means of fighting back.
BLKD makes a play on this by saying Lanzeta is a bit
similar to an innocent suspect, not because he couldn't fight back,
but because he didn't fight back, being a coward in his beef with Shernan)

156
00:11:36,848 --> 00:11:40,679
So? Does it hurt? You can't accept that?

157
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:44,109
Ok then I'll make it more fair

158
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:46,631
This guy who's full of talent

159
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,419
The weapon that I'll use has an Illustrative form

160
00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:54,743
Yes, lanzeta on Lanzeta,
saksakan (stabbing), sharp knife on sharp mind

161
00:11:54,943 --> 00:11:58,691
Yes, lanzeta on saksakan (electrical outlet), it really is shocking

162
00:11:58,891 --> 00:12:04,064
Even when it goes blank, my mind. You'll still have so many wounds.
(Notice he says blank-ang, this can also be Blanka ang
(Even when my mind goes Blanka), he's referencing Blanka
from Street Fighter who has electrical abilities,
hence the 'shocking' setup from earlier )

163
00:12:04,264 --> 00:12:23,566
So how would your blade stand me? When the chainsaw from before wasn't effective?
(He's referencing his past opponent Tipsy D who has a signature chainsaw bar)

164
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:30,184
You're just making it difficult for yourself,
a poor guy who approves of the TRAIN Law
(The TRAIN Law has increased taxes in the PH which in
turn has made commodities more expensive
thus making it even harder for the poor)

165
00:12:30,384 --> 00:12:34,000
How would a lanzeta cut Vic Von Doom?
(Victor Von Doom is a Marvel villain that has titanium armor.
This could also be a nod to MF DOOM because BLKD has referenced him before)

166
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:45,731
Its only useless threats, the ramblings of Kim Jong Un
(Lanzeta does look a bit like North Korea's leader lol)

167
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:49,974
I'm from the future of battle rap of the year 3030

168
00:12:50,174 --> 00:12:52,000
So its clearer than 20/20

169
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:55,286
That your condition now is 50/50

170
00:12:55,486 --> 00:13:00,486
You're fierce, I admit
But only just in rap

171
00:13:00,686 --> 00:13:02,642
I thought you were a bata with a 'K'
(When he says 'K' he means a bata with 'kaya', a kid who is determined)

172
00:13:02,842 --> 00:13:13,366
I was wrong, you're just a batak (addict)
(a play on bata plus 'K', also relevant that Lanzeta
is often accused of using drugs by his opponents)

173
00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:18,180
Just some trip, he got obsessed in the play of pantig (syllables)

174
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,530
You have so many multi-syllabic rhymes and wordplays

175
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:25,545
But you don't perform in any gigs

176
00:13:25,744 --> 00:13:29,090
You're only focusing on deep lyricism in all your attacks

177
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:36,736
Hey, it's only Invictus now who understands you
(Invictus is another Olonggapo MC who also has deep lyricism)

178
00:13:36,936 --> 00:13:38,379
Yes its true that you are a strong MC

179
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:40,544
But its showing on the outside that you are weak

180
00:13:40,744 --> 00:13:46,790
Because what is being deep good for if its not effective in battle?

181
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:58,491
I'm a balakid (obstacle) that symbolizes your dedication

182
00:13:58,691 --> 00:14:03,637
Because the true obstacle is your own limitations

183
00:14:03,837 --> 00:14:07,154
My mission is to bring forth evolution

184
00:14:07,354 --> 00:14:14,367
So my defeat against you, is still my victory

185
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:16,710
Wrecked!

186
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:57,910
Me, I'm true to this culture, I'm true to this art form.
For me, Lanzeta should have won, but thanks for the win anyways
