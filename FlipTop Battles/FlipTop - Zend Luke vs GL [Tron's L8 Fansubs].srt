00:02:32,865 --> 00:02:34,519
Check, CHECK, CHIEECKK

3
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:37,089
I will be calm only for now

4
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:39,386
The applause is louder

5
00:02:39,586 --> 00:02:44,996
A child moth who flirted with a dancing red flower

6
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:46,158
His battle in Cebu (The city where GL's last battle happened)

7
00:02:46,358 --> 00:02:48,964
To a monster, he compared himself

8
00:02:49,164 --> 00:02:52,570
but when you rap you look like a kid goat with a cold that also got rained on

9
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,808
He had glasses on and his haired was tied up

10
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:58,210
You look like a desperate maestro (teacher) that is a bayot (gay)

11
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,787
YOU DON'T FRIGHTEN ANYONE

12
00:02:59,987 --> 00:03:03,809
I will only be scared if you offer me "150"
(150 is a known slang for a gay man offering 150 pesos to suck you off)

13
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:05,539
You're raw, kid

14
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:07,372
Wipe off the drool from your face first

15
00:03:07,572 --> 00:03:11,348
You look like the youngest sibling that gets beaten up by the oldest

16
00:03:11,548 --> 00:03:13,172
Your voice is horrible,

17
00:03:13,372 --> 00:03:14,424
the mark of a loser

18
00:03:14,624 --> 00:03:18,732
Every time you shout in a battle, you look like a kid that got his toy stolen

19
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,509
AFTER I GOT DONE WITH DOSAGE
(Dosage was his previous battle)

20
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:22,184
I was content,

21
00:03:22,384 --> 00:03:23,890
really peaceful

22
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,338
They had me battle you so I can learn to be humble

23
00:03:27,538 --> 00:03:30,286
Your play on words cannot be understood,

24
00:03:30,486 --> 00:03:34,661
too modern, too complicated, and nothing meaningful is being said.

25
00:03:34,861 --> 00:03:35,969
Here I'll teach you,

26
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:37,671
but you will need to pay me

27
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:41,973
If you shake hands with me,
the lines in your palm will change / your destiny will change

28
00:03:44,273 --> 00:03:48,246
My brain is like a world, chaotic, and is
tagilid (crazy / tilted)
(Tagilid can be interpreted as crazy as in a crazy person,
and tilted like how the earth spins)

29
00:03:48,446 --> 00:03:51,390
I'm the horrible smell that seethes from hole in your psyche,

30
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,683
you should listen to me.

31
00:03:52,883 --> 00:03:56,101
The thorns are thick, what's inside this that's flowing?

32
00:03:56,301 --> 00:04:00,039
Venom that came from the roots of cursed trees,

33
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,297
it's so vast and thick here that you can't distinguish illusion from reality.

34
00:04:03,497 --> 00:04:07,044
What you see outside is the reflection of the emotions inside you.

35
00:04:08,005 --> 00:04:12,479
You saw a soldier holding a spear and you are the one he will stab

36
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:14,345
But then the soldier you saw was actually just a tree and some vines

37
00:04:14,346 --> 00:04:16,468
Accompanied by the shadows of your past

38
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:19,869
The solid concrete that you can lean on is pretending to be asleep

39
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:23,438
The real answers are hidden inside me

40
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:31,522
So close your eyes, don't listen to the noises that bring fear and anxiety

41
00:04:31,523 --> 00:04:35,093
Know yourself, the you that's behind the clustered voices

42
00:04:35,293 --> 00:04:38,595
The real me cannot be explained by the mind

43
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:42,793
If you want to follow me, the first key is mushrooms

44
00:04:42,993 --> 00:04:46,300
On the other way is regret, here success is at the end

45
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,438
Do not dictate, and do not judge me

46
00:04:49,638 --> 00:04:52,423
I see the world in my own way

47
00:04:52,623 --> 00:04:55,212
Your eye will be opened so that your mouth will close

48
00:04:55,412 --> 00:05:01,674
You are an infant, before you learn to speak, you must first learn to listen

49
00:05:01,874 --> 00:05:04,605
And you will be found again after you leave

50
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:15,312
If everything has an end, your journey will eventually arrive at its destination

51
00:05:15,512 --> 00:05:19,051
Order in the court, your honor, and the jury,

52
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:20,957
and to those who were anticipating this match-up

53
00:05:21,157 --> 00:05:23,666
I want to ask for your forgiveness, I'm sorry

54
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:25,855
Because I will break the theme

55
00:05:26,055 --> 00:05:27,292
This is not a fight nor war,

56
00:05:27,492 --> 00:05:29,095
this is a trial

57
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:32,843
for a fake prophet, the accused is Lucas

58
00:05:33,043 --> 00:05:34,688
Hailing from Cagayan De Oro (Zend Luke's city)

59
00:05:34,888 --> 00:05:36,110
the new big fish that everyone's been talking about,

60
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,012
the one who will inherit the throne,

61
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,111
a beast in the sea, yes

62
00:05:40,112 --> 00:05:42,014
but you have been washed away by the waves

63
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:47,326
so this fish is simply dead in the 6 minutes of his ahon, game?
(Ahon means 'ascend', typically used when ascending from the ocean.
Ahon is also the name of this FlipTop event so GL is asking
the crowd if the Ahon audience is game. Also relevant that FlipTop 
usually gives MCs 2 minutes per round, 6 minutes in total for the whole battle.)

64
00:05:47,526 --> 00:05:48,491
Because they say that you've just made it

65
00:05:48,691 --> 00:05:50,666
into the starting 5 lineup of Mindanao
(Mindanao is one of the three main islands of PH and FlipTop has a
Mindano division full of talentend MCs)

66
00:05:50,866 --> 00:05:52,947
they say you're the greatest of your batch

67
00:05:53,147 --> 00:05:54,607
like Fukuda of Ryonan
(Slam Dunk series reference, also there is a Mindanao MC named Fukuda)

68
00:05:54,807 --> 00:05:56,995
they say you're the latest of your class

69
00:05:57,195 --> 00:05:58,129
your ink is of a different class

70
00:05:58,329 --> 00:06:00,731
so I congratulate your pen game

71
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:05,822
you're the new ink of Aric, because the tats/Tatz is already faded
(Aric is Anygma's first name, Anygma is the founder of FlipTop
and Uprising Records, he also has tattoos.
Tatz or Tatz Maven is a FlipTop MC who is also in Uprising Records)

72
00:06:06,022 --> 00:06:08,746
Yes, a substitute of the Maven.
You should be aware of that

73
00:06:08,747 --> 00:06:12,306
Sixth threat? No, sixth man, that's your contribution
(Sixth Threat is a FlipTop MC on the supposed starting 5 of Mindanao)

74
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:16,813
Yep you're just a reserve on the bench boy, so Sak I hope you realize
(Sak Maestro is another MC in the supposed starting 5)

75
00:06:17,013 --> 00:06:20,410
that the bench literally got carried

76
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,874
but they say that you're the deep lyricist
that is easy to get (easy to understand)?

77
00:06:25,074 --> 00:06:27,826
Deep? That is easy to get?

78
00:06:28,026 --> 00:06:30,557
Meaning, your existence has a shattered form

79
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,914
Just like a floatie that drowned

80
00:06:34,114 --> 00:06:36,095
Or a fire extinguisher that burned

81
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:42,511
Or like Aklas that sleeps, you get it?
(Aklas was a FlipTop MC who is made fun for doing so much cocaine
that he never gets to sleep)

82
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:45,853
You're smart, but the points you try to get across fail

83
00:06:46,053 --> 00:06:50,327
You're like a lawyer who turned to Tulfo
(Tulfo is a host in a TV show who tries to help people with cases,
just like in the show Judge Judy, but Tulfo isn't an actual law practicioner)

84
00:06:50,527 --> 00:06:54,911
But seriously, deep that is easy to get? Wow!

85
00:06:55,111 --> 00:06:58,500
That just means your style is watered down

86
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:03,386
Kjah, Kial, Ilaya, the ones who are fighting for something,
(He's enumerating FlipTop MCs who can be said are left field)

87
00:07:03,586 --> 00:07:09,037
who can sacrifice entertainment, while you,
you are the most normal from the most crazy/left-field

88
00:07:09,237 --> 00:07:13,932
Because you said, "I am a messiah, I am a reincarnation"

89
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:17,798
"I am a demi-god", you're just putting yourself up on a pedestal

90
00:07:17,998 --> 00:07:19,702
until you make a mess at the top

91
00:07:19,902 --> 00:07:24,808
If Emar is Industry, then you are the smoke
(Emar Industriya is another MC that is of the left field)

92
00:07:25,008 --> 00:07:28,804
"I am as vast as nothingness", "I am as old as the universe"

93
00:07:29,004 --> 00:07:32,786
You're always putting yourself first, in every verse you vomit out

94
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:36,445
Looking at his image in the river, that's how narcissist Lucas is.

95
00:07:36,645 --> 00:07:40,210
But the waves are already polluted, that's why you dont get it

96
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,508
You thought your reflection is what you see in the water,

97
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:45,708
but actually its trash

98
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,069
And then he always screams about dreams and imagination

99
00:07:55,070 --> 00:08:00,771
If the presence is gorging, it is hungry for attention

100
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,799
So even if you are great in projecting yourself,

101
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:04,409
and you provide no lesson or insight,

102
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:08,916
you won't be able to wake the masses, if your projection is astral

103
00:08:09,116 --> 00:08:11,465
So what now? Wasn't that direct to your chest?

104
00:08:11,665 --> 00:08:14,671
No bars that are lackluster, thats how you emphasize

105
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:18,148
And for the jury, it would be good if you try to notice-

106
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:24,578
Count how many times he will mention "me", "me"

107
00:08:24,778 --> 00:08:28,711
And to prove that he is sinful, this is my evidence,

108
00:08:28,911 --> 00:08:34,071
now I call the accused for his defense

109
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:45,777
Squeezed through the eye of a needle in the grass

110
00:08:45,977 --> 00:08:48,669
The entryway is hidden and very hard to find

111
00:08:48,869 --> 00:08:54,530
Everything has an end, this journey will reach its destination eventually

112
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:57,479
And in your leaving, the only thing I want for you to bring for me-

113
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,394
is your second death!

114
00:08:59,594 --> 00:09:02,373
My stomach is growling from the
smell of alimuom (vapor rising from the ground, typically after a rain)

115
00:09:02,573 --> 00:09:08,713
The bridge for you to walk toward the next life,
is the one I'll cross to satisfy my hunger

116
00:09:08,913 --> 00:09:12,995
You said that MCs in Visayas are scared of you?
Yes that's right you are scary

117
00:09:13,195 --> 00:09:17,208
So cute, the result? You lost in your first battle

118
00:09:17,408 --> 00:09:19,356
You're boastful? I'm floating / high

119
00:09:19,556 --> 00:09:20,853
in the air, never faltering

120
00:09:21,053 --> 00:09:24,408
its so easy for me to step on your head that's mahangin (full of air)
(Aside from being full of air, "mahangin" can also mean being boastful)

121
00:09:24,608 --> 00:09:28,829
based on what you've shown, in summary you are weak

122
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:30,739
this is the fruit of your every inconcrete word (bulaang salita or words like bubble)

123
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,243
that's why your tounge is slippery
("madulas na dila" here is close to someone
who is prone to say things they aren't supposed to)

124
00:09:33,443 --> 00:09:38,419
Now you should listen here, those who are like you
are typical, there is nothing special about you

125
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:42,747
You think you are lyrical just because you've learned how to be technical?

126
00:09:42,947 --> 00:09:46,112
You just wanted to fit in, you had no intention to
measure the distance

127
00:09:46,312 --> 00:09:49,275
What you have been doing is already being done by all

128
00:09:49,475 --> 00:09:52,725
Let's just say that you're great in the style so old and used by some

129
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:57,005
In other words, your contribution will only be leftovers

130
00:09:57,205 --> 00:10:00,745
You don't have a mark you can call your own

131
00:10:00,945 --> 00:10:03,624
Your whole being is a debt, you will easily be blown away by the wind

132
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,413
Your papel ('paper' literally, but can mean 'role') in life will easily be forgotten

133
00:10:06,613 --> 00:10:09,424
Too much confidence, you wanted to be among the parade

134
00:10:09,624 --> 00:10:13,197
You got naked and strewn about, but you didn't know that this is a masquerade

135
00:10:13,397 --> 00:10:21,466
Blind to the light guided by the lamp,
intelligently speaking is the mouth of the cave that you just entered

136
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:26,197
In this world, the lies and truths both mean the same

137
00:10:26,397 --> 00:10:30,360
You think you're skilled? Whereas you don't know anything about how things are

138
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,270
The mundane to the unusual is unusual to the mundane

139
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,725
I'm watching your little mind playing around

140
00:10:37,925 --> 00:10:42,736
No discipline and respect, even the veterans you belittled

141
00:10:42,936 --> 00:10:45,361
In the Visayas division you challenged and called out a lot of MCs

142
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,508
Now you're surprised to see me? Like an engkanto (a spirit in PH folklore) suddenly appearing?

143
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:57,663
Didn't you know? That its not good to mention names in gubat!
(Gubat can literally mean forest, and Gubat is the FlipTop event that is held in Visayas)
(It is bad omen to mention names or point fingers in the forest
because engkantos will appear.
It is relevant that GL called out a lot of names in the Gubat event)

144
00:10:57,863 --> 00:11:05,019
I hope you get the messages I'm trying to convey,
I will force in a vast imagination into a narrow understanding

145
00:11:05,219 --> 00:11:08,890
Your head is big, you're too arrogant.
Do you know this story?

146
00:11:08,891 --> 00:11:12,884
A pretentious hunter that got played with by the elements

147
00:11:13,084 --> 00:11:15,508
You're here in the thick of it, so watch your mouth

148
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,309
There is misfortune waiting at your every word

149
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:22,007
You think you're smart? Courageous? That's what you think of yourself?

150
00:11:22,207 --> 00:11:26,067
Yeah sure that's fine. When you have a solid belief, you are easy to fool.

151
00:11:26,267 --> 00:11:32,881
Guest.

152
00:11:33,081 --> 00:11:34,862
Guilty your honor finally

153
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:38,279
Lucas has been imprisoned in a vicious system

154
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:41,257
You want some advice on how to get out?

155
00:11:41,457 --> 00:11:44,397
Then don't miss out because for you there is a "tip si Batas" / Tipsy-Batas
("tip si Batas" in this context means Batas has a tip for him.
Batas is a FlipTop MC that has a later battle with another MC,
Tipsy D, in this same FlipTop event that GL is referencing.
And it also relevant that "batas" the word literally means "law")

156
00:11:44,597 --> 00:11:47,160
So your honor, I'm done with the theme

157
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,156
Let's go back to war, since that is my forte

158
00:11:50,356 --> 00:11:51,916
So its fitting that Zend Luke is shattered

159
00:11:52,116 --> 00:11:54,549
Now that he's no longer in "korte"
(Korte here can both mean "court" as in court of law, and "form"
or "original shape" as in something won't be in korte after being broken/shattered)

160
00:11:54,749 --> 00:11:57,076
Because, you're weird

161
00:11:57,276 --> 00:11:59,950
He is very amazed at the ironies of the world

162
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,193
He's the kind of person that talks to himself

163
00:12:02,394 --> 00:12:04,843
but doesn't even listen

164
00:12:05,043 --> 00:12:08,589
Remember he said, "I'm aroused by the naked truth"

165
00:12:08,789 --> 00:12:11,290
Nice, great move

166
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,602
But wait dude

167
00:12:12,802 --> 00:12:16,810
does that mean that you are romantically excited by fake news?

168
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,897
And another thing he said, "I want to get destiny pregnant"

169
00:12:20,097 --> 00:12:22,152
You want to get destiny pregnant?

170
00:12:22,352 --> 00:12:25,004
Wow how wild, of a different class is your style

171
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:26,823
So what would your child be called?

172
00:12:26,824 --> 00:12:33,041
Destiny's Child?
(Beyonce's group)

173
00:12:33,241 --> 00:12:36,128
But wait, lets go back to top tier bars

174
00:12:36,328 --> 00:12:37,713
Because to jokes I say no sir

175
00:12:37,913 --> 00:12:41,765
I didn't go to Manila to be seen me-jo-ker
(me-jo-ker in this context can be "may joker" in that he doesn't want there to be seen a joker,
another can be "mediocre", he doesn't want to be seen as medicore)

176
00:12:41,965 --> 00:12:46,583
Another one of his lines, "The flame is sinful if the water is clean"

177
00:12:46,783 --> 00:12:50,791
Boom! The crowd went to sleep

178
00:12:50,792 --> 00:12:52,123
the stars awoken

179
00:12:52,323 --> 00:12:54,133
Boom!

180
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,116
His opponent got hit directly /s

181
00:12:57,316 --> 00:12:59,109
But wait, its a pleasure to listen to

182
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:01,748
But in a battle, lame, trash

183
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,246
So its straight facts

184
00:13:03,446 --> 00:13:04,683
Zend, look

185
00:13:04,883 --> 00:13:05,680
wake up

186
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,531
this isn't fake class,

187
00:13:06,731 --> 00:13:07,752
I've brought a great axe

188
00:13:07,952 --> 00:13:10,866
while you brought paintbrush?

189
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:13,797
You went over here, so that your poetry can be heard

190
00:13:13,997 --> 00:13:17,526
While I went over here to make you foam at the mouth

191
00:13:17,726 --> 00:13:21,295
Like the President of America, this bastard is egotistical

192
00:13:21,495 --> 00:13:22,984
being arrogant and ignorant

193
00:13:23,184 --> 00:13:25,251
that's his trump card

194
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:28,372
You're unorthodox? Ha? Unorthodox really?

195
00:13:28,572 --> 00:13:30,128
But why are your skills traditional?

196
00:13:30,328 --> 00:13:35,981
The left field became right-wing so he's seen as self centered

197
00:13:36,181 --> 00:13:39,563
I have a solid foundation, while your backbone's fractured

198
00:13:39,763 --> 00:13:43,305
Yes, you're abstract because scattered around is your structure

199
00:13:43,505 --> 00:13:46,703
Failed angles are what this dumb fuck's always looks for

200
00:13:46,903 --> 00:13:48,638
How would your trip go further, if
("trip" in slang is something that someone craves to do)

201
00:13:48,838 --> 00:13:52,418
ang-gu-long bu-tas
(can both mean "tires have holes" and "angles have holes")

202
00:13:52,618 --> 00:13:55,813
And he's always full of swagger, fake swagger

203
00:13:56,013 --> 00:13:56,866
Sometimes maxed out anger

204
00:13:57,066 --> 00:14:00,360
then suddenly ok and calm for a bit

205
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,814
that's how lodi is with his trips
("lodi" is slang for idol, its idol backwards.
"trip" in slang is something that someone craves to do)

206
00:14:02,014 --> 00:14:03,236
so I'm sorry, thats cheap

207
00:14:03,436 --> 00:14:04,698
so that's why you're from CDO

208
00:14:04,898 --> 00:14:12,128
because your beef is corny
(Zend Luke comes from the city of CDO/Cagayan De Oro, and in the PH
there is also a brand of canned goods called CDO that are well-known
for their corned beef)

209
00:14:12,328 --> 00:14:14,987
So that's why this generic is generic, this is our comment

210
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,526
his poetry has no punch, because it comes from spoken
(spoken poetry)

211
00:14:18,726 --> 00:14:21,503
not for his opponent, disconnected, broken

212
00:14:21,703 --> 00:14:23,347
ya'll think the message is received?

213
00:14:23,547 --> 00:14:39,583
then you're fucking wrong Zend/send

214
00:14:40,783 --> 00:14:45,454
have you ever seen how the moon and sun make love to each other?

215
00:14:45,654 --> 00:14:46,584
I have

216
00:14:46,784 --> 00:14:50,986
Smile of a dog that sings on February 30, out of tune
("Smile like a dog's" is an idiom meaning a smile that has bad intentions behind it)

217
00:14:51,186 --> 00:14:53,576
My deluge brings energy that is of a different class

218
00:14:53,776 --> 00:14:56,368
Power of a storm/typhoon with a third eye

219
00:14:56,568 --> 00:14:59,325
Your journey will now end tonight

220
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:02,567
Your cold body will be the only one that is left

221
00:15:02,767 --> 00:15:05,605
Your expertise will remain as a shadow of someone else

222
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:08,965
The shape of the jungle won't change if you are gone

223
00:15:09,165 --> 00:15:12,322
Thirsty and hungry, Christ's body was given to you

224
00:15:12,522 --> 00:15:15,613
a lost spirit just like St. Elmo's Fire

225
00:15:15,813 --> 00:15:18,489
because you are of old, you have become mundane they said

226
00:15:18,689 --> 00:15:21,704
When everyone looks at you no one's perception will change

227
00:15:21,904 --> 00:15:24,720
When our writtens are weighed, you will shatter completely

228
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,349
my bars will make one's chest heavy like jealousy

229
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:31,802
This is a lineup of stars, a constellation is formed

230
00:15:32,002 --> 00:15:37,972
Just look if you please, I will stay bright in the telescopes of true pilosopo (intelligent people)

231
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:42,033
Carefully chosen themes and concepts have become the signature

232
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,486
This is not just finding fault or being rude

233
00:15:44,686 --> 00:15:46,699
This is literature!

234
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:49,386
Your skills won't advance anymore

235
00:15:49,586 --> 00:15:50,924
even if you train and a lot of time has passed

236
00:15:51,124 --> 00:15:53,946
that will only stay right there like yesterday

237
00:15:54,146 --> 00:15:58,198
we both have fire inherited from the first creators

238
00:15:58,398 --> 00:15:59,997
I want to share light

239
00:15:59,998 --> 00:16:02,130
You want to burn trash

240
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:05,773
My soul becomes naked once I walk on the stage

241
00:16:05,973 --> 00:16:16,036
I pour everything in just to make the glass even wider

242
00:16:16,236 --> 00:16:19,726
Possibility is vast, there is no limitation that is potential

243
00:16:19,926 --> 00:16:21,060
Obstacles are only illusions

244
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:25,182
Everything will pass but not everything has an end

245
00:16:25,382 --> 00:16:28,221
I'm farther and taller than the ones that you wish for

246
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:30,211
My style isn't really new,

247
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:33,213
this was already created in the future

248
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:35,522
My written has an inviting summary

249
00:16:35,722 --> 00:16:38,579
will make anyone exorbitantly obsessive like a girl with curls

250
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:42,570
Even though the age does not show in the intelligence,
they say there is a lack in real experience

251
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:47,524
My spirit/ghost writer, is the ghost of my past life

252
00:16:47,724 --> 00:16:50,984
I don't know what you see, like the memories of someone blind

253
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:54,631
you will keep coming back to it like a promise that was broken

254
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:58,839
even if you forcefully reach the victory that is destined to be mine

255
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:01,995
just like the word apologize, you can't do anything

256
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:05,087
I bring time and tears, every drop counts

257
00:17:05,287 --> 00:17:08,229
I'm like tears, difficult to stop

258
00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:12,051
I'm really only here to offer a hand

259
00:17:12,251 --> 00:17:13,527
Follow the message, not the messenger

260
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:25,254
because he will continue on his personal journey,
thank you very much and good bye to you all

261
00:17:25,454 --> 00:17:28,508
Is this Zend Luke? The champion of FlipTop tryouts?

262
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:32,773
Oh shit! I watched your freestyle. Bro, lit!

263
00:17:32,973 --> 00:17:34,415
So sick!

264
00:17:34,615 --> 00:17:37,087
Off beat!

265
00:17:37,287 --> 00:17:38,831
Yes you fell down on how it goes down

266
00:17:39,031 --> 00:17:41,207
No form in the formula utilized

267
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:42,951
No rhythm in the algorithm

268
00:17:43,151 --> 00:17:44,989
In the tempo, temporary

269
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:48,640
Because he said, he has his own rhythm

270
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,759
He even made excuses, disrespecting Supreme Fist (The DJ)

271
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,645
They say that I should not use the "Train of Thought"
(GL's signature style)

272
00:18:00,845 --> 00:18:02,534
Because you people might not get it

273
00:18:02,734 --> 00:18:05,233
But I don't give a shit as long as my opponent dies.

274
00:18:05,433 --> 00:18:07,357
Game?

275
00:18:07,557 --> 00:18:11,508
Let's start it with Genesis, Cain and Abel? No

276
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,340
Too overused, that part

277
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,587
I'm a beast, an animal that eats its pair

278
00:18:16,787 --> 00:18:18,761
I'm a cannibal in Noah's Ark

279
00:18:18,961 --> 00:18:22,034
Noah's Ark, it will rain, it will rain bullets now

280
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,189
and its gonna flood son, with my handgun

281
00:18:25,389 --> 00:18:34,258
now your end's near, you'll think its Wish Bus, with so much
click here, click here, click here, click here
(Wish 107.5 a popular radio station has a segment "Wish Bus"
that showcases in YouTube videos different artists in the PH,
their outro in these videos has these artists say "click here" numerous times
indicating the subscribe button to ther channel)

282
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:43,555
that's how you subscribe

283
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:46,258
to a magazine, so fast I trigger,

284
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,342
this guy won't reach St. Lukes,
(St. Lukes is a popular hospital)

285
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:51,776
straight to St. Peter he'll go.
(St. Peter is a popular funerarial establishment)

286
00:18:51,976 --> 00:18:54,466
Peter? Parker, Spiderman

287
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,032
In the web he lies, he's caught

288
00:18:56,232 --> 00:18:57,816
But I thought you were clean?

289
00:18:58,016 --> 00:19:01,057
Then why you always on Mary Jane?

290
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,006
What's the advantage of Zend-

291
00:19:04,206 --> 00:19:10,041
"daya" only
(He's trying to reference Zendaya here, the actress for MJ in the recent Spiderman
"daya" also means cheat, he's trying to also say that cheating is
Zend Luke's only advantage)

292
00:19:10,241 --> 00:19:12,731
I'm nervous here in Manila well as you can see

293
00:19:12,931 --> 00:19:18,632
The Train of Thought suddenly stopped, just like the MRT
(MRT is the Metro Rail Transit, trains that run on Manila, known for its many issues
that inconvenience passengers)

294
00:19:18,832 --> 00:19:24,263
Now I'll go crazy, you should feel the desperation

295
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:25,463
I didn't "trip" Doc Pau
(He didn't like Doc Pau, or maybe he didn't like how he lost to Doc Pau?
Doc Pau was his previous battle)

296
00:19:25,663 --> 00:19:27,637
so I skipped my medication

297
00:19:27,837 --> 00:19:29,781
This guy just pretends to be crazy, but people call him 'different' already

298
00:19:29,981 --> 00:19:33,166
Is he the new generation? You're only average when it comes to stats

299
00:19:33,366 --> 00:19:37,252
Too much standard deviation

300
00:19:37,452 --> 00:19:40,789
I exposed his verses, and now you know the limitations

301
00:19:40,989 --> 00:19:45,966
since I studied Zend like meditation

302
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:50,116
I opened up his secret, bible-explanation like

303
00:19:50,316 --> 00:19:51,351
Burned, the Gospel of Luke

304
00:19:51,551 --> 00:19:55,781
No more revelation

305
00:19:55,981 --> 00:20:00,112
I ascended so my opponent will drown

306
00:20:00,312 --> 00:20:01,788
I don't care about the judging

307
00:20:01,988 --> 00:20:03,528
That's how you devour, brad (brother)

308
00:20:03,728 --> 00:20:06,130
Downed, this modern "balagtasan"
(A form of debate done in rhymes. Its quite an old tradition
that people like to compare with FlipTop and rap battling as a whole)

309
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,864
by classic battle rap!

310
00:20:09,064 --> 00:20:11,262
ez, and you still have a round thre-

311
00:20:11,462 --> 00:20:14,844
and you still have a next battle, no one will listen to you anymore

312
00:20:15,044 --> 00:20:20,044
you were unfortunate Lucas because you faced me,
gg
